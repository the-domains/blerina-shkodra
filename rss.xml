            <title><![CDATA[Fabric]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>What we eat is what we are, but are we what we wear? How we cover (or uncover) our bodies is one but many ways to express individuality. It is a choice we make consciously (or unconsciously) when putting those pieces of fabric together. And choices, do leave their fingerprints on identity, be they diminutive or bold. Clothes and garments are a daily routine that can't be escaped from, and as such I try to make it as a fun and pleasurable part of the day. A good hair day is a great day, but a good #ootd is a perfect one. </p>]]></description>
